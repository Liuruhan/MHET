Logic-guided multimodal hybrid embedding transformer for sleep staging

Accurate scoring and interpretation of sleep stages are crucial for maintaining sleep continuity and understanding its structure. Nevertheless, automating sleep scoring remains challenging, despite previous successful attempts. Primarily, due to the clinical scoring protocol, each epoch is assigned a single stage; however, a single epoch can accommodate two or more coexisting stages. Furthermore, time sequencing and logical relationships are linked to the scoring protocol, implying that comparable input features may denote distinct sleep stages. This paper introduces the Logic-related multimodal hybrid embedding transformer (MHET) to tackle these challenges in automating sleep stage scoring. MHET comprises Xception blocks for extracting waveform characteristics, a hybrid embedding block to combine absolute and relative positional information, and a two-path gated transformer for encoding attention patterns. Furthermore, the Logic-Related Output Head (LOH) is utilized to reconstruct logical information in accordance with clinical scoring protocols. We perform various experiments using two datasets (SleepEDF-ST and SleepEDF-SC). The results clearly indicate the superiority of MHET over baseline approaches. Moreover, at the individual level, the state-of-the-art method reached a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.78 $\pm$ 3.33 in stage distribution. Conversely, the MHET method also yielded an MAE of 6.30 $\pm$ 4.58 in stage distribution, highlighting its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art model.
